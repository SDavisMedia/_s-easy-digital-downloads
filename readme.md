Underscores + Easy Digital Downloads Starter Theme
-----

This theme is a style-less combination of the [Underscores (_s) starter theme by Automattic](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) and [Easy Digital Downloads (EDD)](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/).

Every time I build a WordPress theme with _s and integrate it with EDD, I do a couple of hours of dirty work. No more. All the dirty work is done here in this starter theme.

Features
-----
* Page templates for default EDD pages as well as a members area template
* Grid-ready store front template for digital downloads created in EDD. 
* Theme customizer options built to customize EDD output as well as regular blog settings
* EDD-specific sidebar for download pages with download information at the top of the sidebar
* Full _s CSS reset and basic styles as well as HTML structure styles for easy customization

Theme Instructions
-----
If you know how to use _s, you know how to use this starter theme. The same is true if you know how to use your browser inspector. CSS is really all that's missing.

The theme uses the slug "sdm" throughout the files. Do a case-sensitive search and replace in *every* file to use your own theme slug. Change the theme name in the style.css file as well as the rtl.css file. In the functions.php file, be sure to change the definitions. They start with "SDM_" and because they are all caps, your case-sensitive search and replace didn't catch them.

In the languages directory, change the name of the .pot file to match your slug. And of course, name the theme folder whatever you'd like.

With that done, you're ready to activate the theme and write some CSS. It's that easy.

If you have a *popular* EDD extension that should probably be supported by default, let me know.
